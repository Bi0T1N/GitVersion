These examples are illustrating the usage of the supported `GitFlow` workflow
in GitVersion. To enable this workflow, the builtin template
[GitFlow/v1](/docs/workflows/GitFlow/v1.json) needs to be referenced in the
configuration as follows:

```yaml
workflow: GitFlow/v1
mode: ContinuousDelivery
```

Where
the [continuous deployment][continuous-deployment] mode for no branches,
the [continuous delivery][continuous-delivery] mode for
`main`, `support` and `develop` branches and
the [manual deployment][manual-deployment] mode
for `release`, `feature`, `hotfix` and `unknown` branches are specified.

This configuration allows you to publish CI (Continuous Integration) builds
from `main`, `support` and `develop` branches to an artifact repository.
All other branches are manually published. Read more about this at
[version increments](/docs/reference/version-increments).

:::{.alert .alert-info}
The _continuous delivery_ mode has been used for the `main` and the
`support` branch in this examples (specified as a fallback on the root
configuration layer) to illustrate how the version increments are applied.
In production context the _continuous deployment_ mode might be a better
option when e.g. the release process is automated or the commits are tagged
by the pipeline automatically.

## Feature Branches

Feature branches can be used in the `GitFlow` workflow to implement a
feature in an isolated environment. Feature branches will take the feature
branch name and use that as the pre-release label. Feature branches will be
created from a `develop`, `release`, `main`, `support` or `hotfix` branch.

### Create feature branch from main

:::{.alert .alert-info}
After the feature branch is merged, the version on `main` is `2.0.0-5`.
This is due to `main` running in _continuous delivery_ mode. If `main` was
configured to use _continuous deployment_ the version would be `2.0.0`.
:::

### Create feature branch from develop

![GitFlow](/docs/img/DocumentationSamplesForGitFlow_FeatureFromDevelopBranch.png)

:::{.alert .alert-info}
After the feature branch is merged, the version on `develop` is
`1.3.0-alpha.3`. This is due to `develop` running in _continuous delivery_
mode. If `develop` was configured to use _manual deployment_ the version
would still be `1.3.0-alpha.1` and you would have to use pre-release tags
to increment the pre-release label `alpha.1`.

## Hotfix Branches

Hotfix branches are used when you need to do a _patch_ release in the
`GitFlow` workflow and are always created from `main` branch.

### Create hotfix branch

### Create hotfix branch with version number

## Release Branches

Release branches are used for major and minor releases to stabilize a RC
(Release Candidate) or to integrate features (in parallel) targeting different
iterations. Release branches are taken from `main` (or from `develop`) and will
be merged back afterwards. Finally the `main` branch is tagged with the
released version.

Release branches can be used in the `GitFlow` as well as `GitHubFlow` workflow.
Sometimes you want to start on a large feature which may take a while
to stabilize so you want to keep it off main.
In these scenarios you can either create a long lived
feature branch (if you do not know the version number this large feature will go
into, and it's non-breaking) otherwise you can create a release branch for the
next major version. You can then submit pull requests to the long lived feature
branch or the release branch.

## Develop Branch

## Support Branches

Support branches are not really covered in GitFlow, but are essential if you
need to maintain multiple major versions at the same time. You could use support
branches for supporting minor releases as well. If you are just supporting the
majors, then name your branch `support/<major>.x` (i.e `support/1.x`), to
support minors use `support/<major>.<minor>.x` or `support/<major>.<minor>.0`.
(i.e `support/1.3.x` or `support/1.3.0`)

![GitFlow](/docs/img/DocumentationSamplesForGitFlow_SupportBranch.png)

:::{.alert .alert-info}
Depending on what you name your support branch, you may or may not need a
hotfix branch. Naming it `support/1.x` will automatically bump the patch,
if you name it `support/1.3.0` then the version in branch name rule will
kick in and the patch _will not_ automatically bump, meaning you have to
use hotfix branches.
